1) I learned this week about how binary trees can be used to
make certain tasks simpler. Also, I learned how x = change(x) pattern 
really simplifies code and makes it less redundant

2) I enjoyed this week the process of walking through the tree
and following along. Also, I enjoyed creating 20 questions because
it is a game I used to play.

3) I found frustrating at first the on implementing a tree
because it was almost like recursion but yet it required a 
little bit of different thinking perspective

4) I found particularly helpful this week the videos Kevin 
posted for the problems during lecture.
